# English Words Analysis Program

A C program that analyzes English words and discovers linguistic relationships including subwords, verb conjugations, lexical proximity, and anagrams.

---

## Features

- **Word Analysis** - Count characters, vowels, consonants, and syllables
- **Subword Detection** - Find words contained within larger words (e.g., "art" in "start")
- **Verb Forms** - Link base verbs with their -ed and -ing forms
- **Lexical Proximity** - Find words differing by exactly one character
- **Anagram Detection** - Discover anagrams (e.g., "listen" and "silent")
- **Dynamic Management** - Insert and delete words with automatic relationship recalculation

---

## Limitations

Many features and rules are hardcoded; this is not an NLP project.

---

## Quick Start

### Build
```bash
make
```

### Run
```bash
make run
```

Or directly:
```bash
./build/bin/english_words
```

### Clean
```bash
make clean      # Remove build artifacts
make rebuild    # Clean and rebuild
```

---

## Usage

The program loads words from `persistence/words.txt` on startup. Use the interactive menu to explore relationships:

| Option | Action                                             |
|--------|----------------------------------------------------|
| **0**  | Display word information                           |
| **1**  | Show subword chains                                |
| **2**  | Show verb forms (-ed/-ing)                         |
| **3**  | Show words with one char added *(not implemented)* |
| **4**  | Show lexically close words                         |
| **5**  | Show anagrams                                      |
| **6**  | Insert a new word                                  |
| **7**  | Delete a word                                      |
| **8**  | Display statistics                                 |
| **9**  | Exit                                               |

## Word File Format

Words in `persistence/words.txt` should have syllables separated by forward slashes:

```
hel/lo
world
pro/gram/ming
ed/u/ca/tion
```

## Technical Details

### Data Structures
- **WordNode** - Doubly-linked list node with word properties and relationships
- **Syllable** - Linked list for syllable storage
- **LetterList** - 26 lists (A-Z) for efficient word organization

### Algorithms
- **Subword Detection** - Pattern matching with separation tracking
- **Verb Generation** - Rule-based conjugation (CVC doubling, silent-e handling)
- **Lexical Distance** - Single-character difference with circular chain prevention
- **Anagram Detection** - Sorted character comparison

### Constraints
- Maximum 1000 words
- Maximum 50 characters per word
- Maximum 10 characters per syllable

### Error Codes
- `SUCCESS = 0` - Operation completed successfully
- `ERROR_FILE_NOT_FOUND = -1` - File not found
- `ERROR_MEMORY_ALLOCATION = -2` - Memory allocation failed
- `ERROR_INVALID_INPUT = -3` - Invalid input provided
- `ERROR_WORD_EXISTS = -4` - Word already exists
- `ERROR_WORD_NOT_FOUND = -5` - Word not found

---

## Requirements

- **Compiler** - GCC with C99 support
- **Build System** - GNU Make
- **Platform** - Cross-platform (Windows/Linux/macOS)

---

## Memory Management

All dynamic memory is properly tracked and freed. Verify with valgrind:
```bash
make memcheck
```

---

## Examples

**Subword Chain:**
```
art --> start --> restart --> (end)
```

**Verb Forms:**
```
study --> studied --> studying
```

**Lexically Close:**
```
cat --> bat --> hat --> mat --> (end)
```

**Anagrams:**
```
listen --> silent --> enlist --> (end)
```
